André Danjon (1936) estimated this limit at about 7°; later Odeh (2004) refined it to 6.4° and Schaefer (1991) suggested it may vary with atmospheric conditions. Methods like Yallop and Odeh incorporate a Danjon cut-off; if elongation is below this limit, the crescent is automatically classified as not visible."

This simple rule captures the basic idea that the moon must be above the horizon long enough after sunset, but it ignores factors such as elongation, atmospheric extinction, and location."
